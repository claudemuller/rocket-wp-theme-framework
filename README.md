## Description

## Installation

1. Install all bower dependencies via the cli: `bower install`
2. Then install all npm dependencies via the cli: `npm install`


## Usage

1. To run Gulp issue the following in the cli: `gulp` and the plugin _watch_ will watch your theme for any changes and gulp will run the appropriate task.
2. Put all unoptimised images into the `images/src` directory
3. Put all uncompressed .js into the `js/src` directory
4. Livereload is enabled on this theme, so if you'd like to make use of it, install the appropriate [plugin](http://feedback.livereload.com/knowledgebase/articles/86242-how-do-i-install-and-use-the-browser-extensions-) for your browser
